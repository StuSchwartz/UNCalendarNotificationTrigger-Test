# UNCalendarNotificationTrigger-Test
Example playgrounds to show how to configure UNCalendarNotificationTriggers for Local Notifications.

UNCalendarNotificationTrigger shows how to configure the trigger to notify for daily, weekly, monthly and yearly.

This also shows the problem I am having with Xcode 9.x where the monthly notification is incorrect. However, this works correctly in Xcode 8.x


UNCalendarNotificationTrigger - multi is a stretch to push the bounds of what it impiles in the DateComponents documentation. Where it seems to imply that you can setup a trigger for a multi count. Such as every N days (weeks, months or years). I have been unable to get this to work.
